	<h1> <a href=index.html> Lucas Lytel </a> </h1>
	<p> 	My name is Lucas Lytel. I am a student at Tufts Univesity Studying Political Science and French. I am currently looking for jobs in the political consulting world. Having worked on Elizabeth Warrne's succesful re-election campaign, I understand what it takes to be adaptable and work with a high attention to detail.</p>

	<p> I am passionate about politics and bringing people together. I believe that there is more that unites us than divides us. I hope to illuminate our similarities so that we can tackle issues that require our upmost cooperation.</p>
