README for Assignment 1

Tuesday January 29th, 2019 
	I spent 3 hours working on Assignment 1. Mostly configuring the set-up with the tufts.cs server. I began basic development of the index page. Used git to create a basic repo for my website.

	I spent 4 hours working on the buttons at the bottom. Finding images and resizing them. I added in my css file and began making the site look nicer. Haven't started on the resume or bio portion. I drew inspiration from https://www.josefrbober.com/ and the Tufts CS website. 

Wednesday Feb 6th
	I spent a remaining 3 hour finalizing the assignment. Adding a resume page with a style sheet. Adding a bio page. And submitting it. Spent tons of time correcting errors and making sure the site works via github.

Thursday Feb 7th 
	I spent an additional 4 hours working on redoing the resume page so that it did not have any errors. Learend about how to manage different lists and classes. Talked with yves about how to do a bulleted list but did not end up using that information. Struggled with getting my index.css file to show on the tufts hosted version of my website but it works on github.
